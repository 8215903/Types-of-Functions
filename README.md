# Types-of-Functions

For this project, I will write a smart contract to create my own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix. Once deployed, it should be able to interact with it for walk-through video. From chosen tool, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.
